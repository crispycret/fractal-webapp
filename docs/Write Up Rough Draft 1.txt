Fractal Engine

A webapp that allows a user to generate a fractal zoom movie, img or gif.


The movie version of the fractal engine is the main overarching feature of the project.
The gif version of the fractal engine is range of keyframes that can be auto trimmed to fit a specific file size on render.
The img version of the fractak engine is a snapshot of a keyframe of the overall movie version of fractal engine.

While the movie version is the ultimate goal and my unsufficient understanding of HTML Canvas elements and Web development in general I will start and prototype the features in reverse order.

This will most likely cause version 2.0 of the project to be almost entirely refactored, but as this is a learning project for me, splitting the final version of this initial idea into 2 seperate projects that attain the same goal is fine if not more beneficial to highlight the importance of the understanding of how to build a system to solve a problem.

Agile development will be the process framwork that I use to develop this webapp. I  will use the understanding I have gained from my school to the best of my abilities to show to myself what I actually understand or don't understand.
This will also be open sourced upon completion to recieve feedback of where my misunderstanding are and hopefully this can become a guide to others in learning how to build a system from scratch on your own.


While many features can be appended to this project later, such as a social media extension to showcases discoveries in the fractal engine.


The type of fractals the system should ultimatley have is an total encompassment of all known fractals.
A method should be developed to allow people to attempt to model their own fractals.
An effort should be made in using AI to generate new fractals, perhaps unknown ones that could have a significant impact in some form of understanding.


The basic types of fractals to include in the first generation would be Sierpi≈Ñski triangle, Julia sets, mandlebrot sets and a few other of the well known fractals if it does not increase the time of completion.
They can always be added later if the development is done properly and modularly.


# Rough Draft Epics:
I as a user would like to be able to save my generated fractal as a movie, gif or image.
I as a user would like to be able to manually select from a list of fractal types to generate a fractal.
I as a user would like to be able to click a button that will randomly generate the type of fractal i have selected and with a random color scheme.
I as a user would like to be able to click a button that will randomly generate an kind of fractal.

I as a user would like to be able to share this fractal engine object with others on social media but mantain security and ownership of the object.
I as a user would like to be able to share this fractal engine object with others on social media and have a way from them to modify the object and re share it with me and others.

I as a user would like to be able to overaly different fractals onto real images, uploaded videos and fractal engine projects.
I as a user would like to be able to use keyframes to create a zooming/unzooming fractal movie, gif or to save as a image.
I as a user would like to be able to modify attributes of the fractal such as nodes/resolution (depends on fractal, i think?), iterations, color schemes of different values of groups.
I as a user would like to be able to zoom in real time using my mouse as the focal point and the mouse wheel (or +,-) to zoom in and out (requires a massive amount of computation power i believe).






# USE CASES:
I as a user, would like to be able to generate different types of fractals with as little effort possible. ( HIGH PRITORITY )
I as a user, would like to be able to download the generated fractal as different image types.
I as a user, would like to be able to save multiple generated fractal so that I can modify them later.

I as a user, would like to be able to generate different types of fractals with as much effort as possible. ( MEDIUM PRIORITY )spa
I as a user would like to use keyframes to set paramaters and zoom locations to create a moving image, gif, movie with a parameter for smoothing.

I as a user, would like to be able to attempt to create a new type of fractal both starting visually and mathematically. ( COMPLEX LOW PRIORITY)
